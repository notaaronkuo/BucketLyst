## Executive Summary

BucketLyst is a product which is designed to help users create and share lists of their favorite places to visit. People create lists of their favorite places all the time, and this may appear in the form of a locally saved notes app, or Google Maps list. That means that the user base exists, and we’re looking to elevate their experience through a user-friendly interface which helps users organize, manage, and manipulate their lists easily. Whether you're planning a trip, just want to keep track of your favorite spots, or looking for a place to explore, BucketLyst is the perfect tool.

One of BucketLyst’s main features is its ability to organize and manipulate the lists. For example, users can use the diff checker to compare differences of their and their following lists and see how they've changed over time. They can also use tags to categorize their favorite places by type (e.g., restaurants, museums, parks) or by location (e.g., New York City, Paris, Tokyo). Moreover, users can filter and search the spots by tags, categories, cities, radius from a user's current location etc. This allows users to find the perfect spot they are looking to go!

Another key feature of BucketLyst is allowing users to see public lists created by other users. Users can choose to make their lists public to everyone or share them with friends, making it easy to collaborate and plan trips together. Additionally BucketLyst integrates with Google Maps, so users can import data from Google Maps, making it easy to get started with the app.

With two main features combined, BucketLyst makes it easy to find the best spot whether the spot is recommended by their best friends or their favorite influencers. The app's emphasis on community-driven recommendations, sharing, and filtering sets it apart from other review sites or travel guides. This can be a great way to discover new places and get inspiration for your own travel plans from someone you trust.

Currently there are several competitors that offer lists in conjunction with maps integration. Google Maps is the primary competitor, because of the size of their market capture. Where Google Maps fails at is their advertising of this useful and demanded functionality. Most users have little knowledge of creating lists on Google Maps. With proper advertisement and deployment, we can capitalize on this and provide a service that addresses the lack of functionality from our competitors.

## Main Use Cases

Summarize key categories of users/actors for your application –
their general characteristics, goals, skills, pain points related to the application you are developing. About 1/3 of a page per actor – see class notes. (Note: in key categories you stay general, in use cases you say how actors/users will use your app (at high level)). Then provide 8-10 main use cases (one paragraphs for each use case)

- see class notes on more detailed format for requirements.

Focus only on main use cases. For each Use Case you develop, first create it in text format, and then describe it using a Use Case diagram. Don’t forget to add in your user cases possible situations where the user or/and your app/actors do not perform actions as expected. Then, describe a possible solution. (see class slides) – tell us a story about who and how the application is used. Focus on WHAT users do, their skill level, not on HOW is the SW implemented. NOTE: avoid specific on HOW functions will be done and text resembling user manual: this is supposed to guide the design of the future product and is NOT a description of how the product will work (you don’t know that yet) – see class slides for details. Please assign a descriptive title to each use case so it can be tracked.

## Main Data Items and Entries

*Define main terms, data structures and “items” or “entities” at high or logical (not implementation) level (e.g. name, meaning, usage, and NOT how the data is stored in memory) so it is easier to refer to them in the document. Focus on key terms (main data elements/records used in your app, types of users and their privileges etc. These terms and their names must be used consistently from then on in all documents, user interface, in naming SE components and database elements etc. In cases where you attach behavior and privileges to data items (e.g. user types) that also drives the design of the SW. In later milestones you will add more implementation details for each item. You will later expand this section with more details. This will help define planning and design for the DB for example.*

## Competitive Analysis

Currently, the market is composed of established companies that have integrated list creation into their service offerings, placing emphasis on their core competencies. Notably, Yelp and Google Maps have achieved prominence through their respective review system and location display features. In addition to our own core capabilities, we intend to enhance and adopt certain attributes of our competitors. Specifically, we recognize Yelp's Collections as a dominant name brand in the market, which we compete with through our own feature set: list manipulation, customized tags, and detailed descriptions. Our approach provides greater flexibility in sorting, organizing, and presenting content to our users' followers. Furthermore, we distinguish ourselves from Yelp Collections by incorporating Google Maps' ability to showcase all locations from a list on a map. We aim to harmonize two dominant services while preserving optimal user experience.
