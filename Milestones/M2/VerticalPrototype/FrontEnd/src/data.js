    pursuing a masters degree in Computer Science at San Francisco State \
    University. In my current project, I am leading a team and responsible \
    for project management, people management, as well as coding for the \
    backend. Alongside my studies, I also work part-time as a software \
    developer at school, where I specialize in programming languages such as \
    Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. My past projects \
    have ranged from building websites with login functionalities and \
    split-screen multiplayer games to web scraping using Python. I have a \
    passion for technology and I am always eager to learn new things. When I \
    am not working, you can find me with my nose in a book or engaging with \
    ChatGPT lately. I approach life with a positive and growth-oriented \
    mindset and believe in being friendly and open to new connections. I \
    welcome anyone to say hello if they see me around. Lets connect.',

    My only knowledge of back-end is from web development class, but back-end \
    has always interested me so I hope to learn and have a strong back-end foundation. \
    My biggest strength is communicating and having an open-mind mentality to all sorts of ideas. \
    You can usually find me driving on the backroads or I would stay home and play games with friends. \
    I hope to work in the car industry as a Software Engineer. \
    Overall, I have a never give up mindset, positive, and have a down to earth personality. \
    Looking forward to working with everybody!`,

    work in the frontend due to my background in creating artwork and design which \
    is my stronger suit. Aside from CS, some of my hobbies include drawing, playing \
    piano, exploring new places, and longboarding. \
